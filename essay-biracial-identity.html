            <div class="essay-title">Full Essay: Biracial, But Whose Lens?</div>
            <div class="essay-content">
                <p>The question has followed me my entire life: "What are you?" As a biracial daughter of a Black father and a white mother, I have always existed in the space between. But unlike my darker-skinned brother, whose identity is visible the moment
                    someone looks at him, my identity is ambiguous. My light skin, straightened hair, and ambiguous features often lead people to make assumptions about who I am. I have been mistaken for white, Latina, Middle Eastern, and everything in
                    between. For years, I found this ambiguity to be both a blessing and a curse.</p>
                <p>The curse manifested early. When I was eight years old, I remember sitting at the lunch table with a group of Black girls. We were talking about the upcoming Martin Luther King Jr. assembly, and one girl turned to me and asked, "Are you
                    even Black? You don't really count because you're not really Black." I felt the sting of those words deeply. I had always considered myself Black—my father was Black, our family celebrated Black culture, and I had grown up with a deep
                    connection to that heritage. Yet in that moment, I was being told that my lightness erased that identity. I spent the rest of lunch fighting back tears, feeling as though I didn't belong anywhere.</p>
                <p>The blessing of my ambiguous appearance manifested in different ways. I was never followed in stores the way my brother was. Teachers seemed to expect the same academic success from me without the same stereotypes they applied to him.
                    In predominantly white spaces, I had a certain invisibility that allowed me to move through the world without some of the burdens my brother carried. I was rarely if ever stopped by police. I was more likely to be given the benefit
                    of the doubt in situations where my brother would have faced immediate suspicion. As I got older, I became acutely aware that my lighter skin afforded me privileges that my brother, despite being biracial like me, did not have.</p>
                <p>This realization created an internal conflict. How could I claim my Blackness while simultaneously benefiting from colorism? How could I talk about racial injustice when my own appearance had sheltered me from some of its worst manifestations?
                    I struggled with guilt, feeling as though my privileges somehow invalidated my claim to a Black identity. I questioned whether I had the right to speak about the Black experience when my experience was so fundamentally different from
                    that of darker-skinned Black people.</p>
                <p>The turning point came during my sophomore year when I attended a workshop on multiracial identity. The speaker, a woman who could pass for white but identified as Latina and Black, spoke about the isolation of occupying in-between spaces.
                    She talked about how lighter-skinned people of color often experience a form of invisibility that comes with its own psychological toll. She discussed how ambiguous appearance doesn't make one's identity any less valid—it simply makes
                    it more complicated. In that room, surrounded by other young people who understood the specific pain of not quite belonging anywhere, I felt seen in a way I had never experienced before.</p>
                <p>I realized that claiming my biracial identity wasn't about splitting myself in half or choosing one heritage over the other. It was about acknowledging the full complexity of who I am. I am Black and white. I benefit from white privilege
                    while carrying the weight of Black identity. I can move through white spaces relatively easily while still being profoundly connected to Black culture, family, and history. These truths are not contradictory—they are simply the reality
                    of my existence.</p>
                <p>My journey toward self-acceptance accelerated when I began to examine how my ambiguous appearance gave me a specific form of agency. Yes, I had been told by some Black girls that I didn't "really count" as Black. But I also had the power
                    to define myself. I could walk into any space and claim my identity with confidence, not based on what others perceived when they looked at me, but based on the truth of my heritage and my values. I started wearing my hair natural
                    more often, not because I felt pressure to prove my Blackness, but because it felt authentic to me. I became more vocal about racial justice, not despite my light skin, but because I understood that being a biracial person who looks
                    white gave me a responsibility to use that privilege as an ally.</p>
                <p>Now, when people ask me "What are you?" I have learned to reframe the question. I am not a puzzle to be solved by someone else's perception. I am a biracial woman who is unapologetically Black, unapologetically white, and unapologetically
                    myself. My identity is not determined by the color of my skin or the assumptions of others. It is determined by my history, my values, my love for my family, and my commitment to understanding and standing up against injustice. My
                    ambiguous appearance is not something I have to explain or justify. It is simply part of my story—a story that is uniquely mine and valid in its complexity.</p>
