            <div class="essay-title">Full Essay: The Weight and Wonder of My Name</div>
            <div class="essay-content">
                <p>My name has always been a source of both pride and frustration. Growing up in a large, blended family where my siblings answered to names like Emma, Sarah, and Michael—names that rolled off the tongue easily and required no explanation—I
                    stood out simply by introducing myself. When teachers called roll on the first day of school, there would inevitably be a pause, a stumble, an attempt to pronounce a name they had never encountered before. Some teachers would simply
                    skip over me and come back to it at the end. Some would ask me to correct them, which meant repeating my name multiple times just so they could get it right. In elementary school, I remember feeling a flush of embarrassment each time.
                    I wanted a name that was normal, forgettable, the kind that wouldn't make people turn their heads.</p>
                <p>But as I grew older, something shifted. I realized that while my unusual name had initially felt like a burden, it was also a gift—a constant reminder that I was different, that I had my own identity separate from the crowd. Where my siblings
                    could blend in, I couldn't. This distinction forced me to own my uniqueness rather than hide from it. I decided that if I was going to stand out simply by my name, I was going to stand out in all the ways that mattered. I threw myself
                    into my studies with renewed purpose. I took on leadership roles in clubs. I challenged myself to excel not just academically but as a person.</p>
                <p>I came to see my name as a silent challenge—a promise I made to myself that I would live up to something significant. I wasn't going to be just another student; I wasn't going to settle for average. My name demanded that I be intentional,
                    disciplined, and authentic. When I faced obstacles, I thought about my name and refused to take the easy way out. When I was tempted to blend in, I remembered that I didn't have that luxury and decided to lead instead. In my sophomore
                    year, when I was considering whether to run for student body president, I hesitated. I had always been successful academically, but leadership felt risky. Then I thought about my name—how it had already set me apart my entire life.
                    Why not use that distinction as a foundation for something more?</p>
                <p>I ran for student body president and won. I created new initiatives focused on inclusion and community. I worked to make sure that every voice in our school was heard, perhaps because I had spent so much of my life feeling like my own
                    voice needed to be heard. My name, which had once seemed like an anchor, had become a symbol of my agency and my choice to define myself rather than be defined by others' expectations.</p>
                <p>One moment crystallized this transformation for me. During my senior year, a young girl came up to me in the hallway. She shared that she had always been self-conscious about her own unique name, but seeing me embrace mine had given her
                    courage to do the same. She said, "Your name matches you perfectly. You're exactly the kind of person someone named that should be." In that moment, I understood that my journey with my name wasn't just about personal development.
                    It was about setting an example for others that being different isn't something to apologize for—it's something to claim with pride.</p>
                <p>Now, when I introduce myself, there is no hesitation in my voice. My name is no longer something I explain away or minimize. It is a fundamental part of who I am—a statement of my commitment to excellence, authenticity, and leadership.
                    I have learned that the things that make us stand out aren't flaws to be hidden; they are gifts to be developed. My unusual name taught me this lesson long before I had the words to articulate it. As I move forward into college and
                    beyond, I carry this name with confidence, knowing that it represents not just who I was born as, but who I have chosen to become.</p>
