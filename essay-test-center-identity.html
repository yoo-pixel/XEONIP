            <div class="essay-title">Full Essay: More Than a Number</div>
            <div class="essay-content">
                <p>The test center smells like anxiety and pencil lead. I sit at my assigned desk, number 247 printed on the small card in front of me. Around me, dozens of other students sit silently, each of us reduced to a test ID and a standardized score.
                    The proctor checks my ID and verifies my test booklet. She never learns my name. I am 247 for the next three hours. Looking around the room, I see hundreds of years of human experience—dreams, fears, talents, struggles—all temporarily
                    compressed into a thin file with my photograph and a series of numbers that will soon determine how many colleges consider me worthy of their attention. And I wonder: how much of who I am fits into those bubbles?</p>
                <p>The truth is, my identity cannot be captured by any standardized test. When I leave this test center, I will go home to my grandmother, who has taught me more about resilience and grace than any textbook ever could. My grandmother immigrated
                    to this country with a third-grade education, worked as a housecleaner for twenty years, and raised six children on an income that would make most people despair. She is the reason I push myself, the reason I refuse to make excuses,
                    the reason I believe that circumstances don't define destiny. But there is no test score for wisdom. There is no percentile ranking for the strength that comes from watching someone you love face adversity with dignity.</p>
                <p>After the test center, I will go to soccer practice. I have played since I was eight years old, and soccer is where I learned about teamwork, strategy, and the exhilaration of pushing my body to its limits. I'm not the fastest player on
                    the field, and I'll never be recruited by a Division I program, but I am a leader. My teammates look to me not because of my individual talent but because of the way I play—thoughtfully, with intention, with genuine care for the person
                    next to me. I will graduate this year as one of the team captains, and I will have influenced the way dozens of young women think about competition and camaraderie. But there is no standardized test for leadership. There is no score
                    for the pride I feel when a younger teammate scores her first goal.</p>
                <p>I am also an artist. I paint, though I don't tell many people this. My paintings are strange, sometimes chaotic, always deeply personal. They explore themes of identity, displacement, and the search for meaning. I'm not skilled enough
                    to sell my work or get into a prestigious art school, but painting is where I process my emotions and communicate truths I cannot express in words. When I paint, I am not trying to achieve a perfect score or impress an invisible evaluator.
                    I am simply creating something that matters to me. There is no test for artistic integrity, no multiple choice question that can measure the healing power of creative expression.</p>
                <p>My identity is that of a volunteer. For the past two years, I have worked with students in underfunded schools, tutoring them in math and English. I watch children who have every reason to fall behind refuse to give up. I see their faces
                    light up when a concept suddenly clicks. I witness their determination to succeed despite obstacles that are far greater than my own. These children have changed me in ways that no test could ever capture. They have shown me what true
                    courage looks like, and they have reminded me that education is a privilege I should never take for granted. The work I do with them will not show up on any college application as a test score, but it has shaped my values and my understanding
                    of what it means to make a difference.</p>
                <p>I am a friend, a listener, a person who people come to when they need advice or simply someone to sit with in the darkness. I am someone who has struggled with depression and anxiety, who has made mistakes, who has learned that vulnerability
                    is not weakness. I am someone who values loyalty, honesty, and the kind of love that shows up without needing to be announced. These qualities are fundamental to who I am, but they don't fit into any standardized assessment.</p>
                <p>As I walk out of the test center and into the afternoon sun, I remind myself that the score I receive in a few weeks will tell colleges something about my academic abilities. It might open doors or close them. It might become a source
                    of pride or disappointment. But it will never tell them who I really am. It will never capture the depth of my character, the scope of my passions, or the true measure of my worth. I am more than a number. I am a complex human being
                    shaped by love, struggle, creativity, and purpose. That is the identity that will ultimately define my life, regardless of what any test center produces.</p>
