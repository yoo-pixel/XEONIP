            <div class="essay-title">Full Essay: Persistence in Mathematics</div>
            <div class="essay-content">
                <p>I remember the moment I fell in love with mathematics. I was eleven years old, sitting in my middle school algebra class, when my teacher wrote a simple equation on the board and asked us to solve for x. Most of my classmates groaned,
                    but something clicked inside me. I watched as the abstract symbols transformed into logic, and suddenly, the solution appeared. That feeling—of unlocking a hidden pattern in chaos—became addictive. While other students doodled in their
                    notebooks, I remained transfixed by the elegant structure of mathematical proofs and the way complex problems reduced to their simplest, most beautiful forms.</p>
                <p>As I progressed through high school, my passion for mathematics only deepened. What had seemed like abstract theory in algebra became tangible when I discovered calculus in my junior year. Suddenly, mathematics was no longer just about
                    solving for unknowns; it was about understanding change, motion, and the fundamental principles that govern our universe. I spent countless hours working through problem sets, not because they were assigned, but because each solved
                    equation felt like discovering a hidden truth about how the world works. My friends would ask why I loved something so challenging, and I would struggle to explain. How could I tell them that mathematics was my language—a way to express
                    ideas that felt impossible to articulate in words?</p>
                <p>However, my journey with mathematics was not without obstacles. In ninth grade, I was placed in a lower-level algebra class due to some unfortunate standardized test scores. The moment I received the notification, I felt defeated. Around
                    me were students who seemed indifferent to the subject, and I worried that I would be held back, that my passion would be limited by this single label. I could have accepted this placement as permanent, but something inside me refused
                    to give up. I began staying after school with my teacher, asking questions, seeking additional resources, and slowly but surely, understanding the material at a deeper level. By the end of the year, I had not only mastered the content
                    but also retaken the diagnostic exam and scored well enough to advance to the honors track.</p>
                <p>That experience taught me that passion without action is merely a dream. The following year, I enrolled in honors geometry, then honors algebra II, and finally, honors precalculus. Each level brought new challenges, new concepts that pushed
                    the boundaries of my understanding. My sophomore year, when I took AP Biology, I realized that mathematics was not just beautiful in isolation—it was the foundation of understanding everything else. The way populations grow, the way
                    chemical reactions occur, the way ecosystems balance themselves—all of it could be described through mathematical models. My love for mathematics and science became inseparable, united by a shared elegance and precision.</p>
                <p>Now, as I look back on my journey, I see that my initial question as an eleven-year-old—"Why do we need to know this?"—has been answered a thousand times over. Mathematics is not just about finding the right answer; it is about developing
                    the perseverance to solve complex problems, the creativity to approach challenges from new angles, and the humility to learn from mistakes. These are not just mathematical skills; they are life skills. As I prepare for college, I know
                    that whatever field I pursue, the foundation I have built through mathematics will serve me well. More importantly, I have learned that true passion requires dedication, and that the obstacles we face are not barriers to success—they
                    are simply part of the path that makes success meaningful.</p>
